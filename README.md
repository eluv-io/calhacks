# Eluvio instructions for Cal Hacks 5.0

### Welcome!

Eluvio is thrilled to be part of this great Hackathon, and to work with all of you on great solutions to two possible challenges using our content fabric platform. 

The Eluvio Content Fabric is a work-in-progress, novel decentralized platform for managing, distributing, selling and enjoying digital content over the Internet. The platform combines together several new technologies we've built from ground: Fast, machine learning driven content routing and low-latency media streaming; Decentralized storage of media and metadata without duplication; Programmable, just-in time composition; Trustless content protection from creator to consumer; Blockchain-controlled content access; Smart contracts for multi-party transactions.

For Calhacks, we have created two significant "challenges" -- one that applies the content fabric APIs around content management, programmable media ("bitcode"), and blockchain smart contracts -- and a second challenge focused on machine learning around content in the fabric.

Please review the Wiki for more specific information about each challenge: [https://github.com/eluv-io/calhacks/wiki](https://github.com/eluv-io/calhacks/wiki)

The best place to start for the content API fabric challenge is this repo: [https://github.com/eluv-io/elv-client-js](https://github.com/eluv-io/elv-client-js).
Look here for information about programmable media: [https://github.com/eluv-io/content-bitcode](https://github.com/eluv-io/content-bitcode)

For the machine learning challenge, refer to this repo: [https://github.com/eluv-io/audio-tagging](https://github.com/eluv-io/audio-tagging)

Join us onsite CalHacks or on our slack channel for live discussions and tutorials. Good luck and hope to "meet" you soon!

## For Mac OS Users - Download the Eluvio Continuum Reference Application to get a "Taste" of the Content Fabric

This is a simple but fun reference application that will allow you to browse libraries as "channels", stream video published into the fabric, and exercise the blockchain smart contract capability built in.  Download the Continuum app .zip, unzip it and run /Continuum.app/Contents/MacOS/Continuum  In the introductory window enter an account name of your choice and a password and you will be automatically connected to the test fabric platform.
