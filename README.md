# Eluvio instructions for Cal Hacks 5.0

### Welcome!

Eluvio is thrilled to be part of this great Hackathon, and to work with all of you on great solutions to two possible challenges using our content fabric platform. 

The Eluvio Content Fabric is a work-in-progress, novel decentralized platform for managing, distributing, selling and enjoying digital content over the Internet. The platform combines together several new technologies we've built from ground such as 
#### Fast, machine learning driven content routing and low-latency media streaming, 
#### Decentralized storage of media and metadata without duplication
#### Programmable, just-in time composition
#### Trustless content protection from creator to consumer
#### Blockchain-controlled content access
#### Smart contracts for multi-party transactions

For Calhacks, we have created two significant "challenges" -- one that applies the content fabric APIs around content management, programmable media ("bitcode"), and blockchain smart contracts -- and a second challenge focused on machine learning around content in the fabric. We encourage you to review the docs in the wiki for details of each of these challenges and pointers to sample code in our public repo's.

Join us onsite CalHacks or on our slack channel for live discussions and tutorials. Good luck and hope to "meet" you soon!
