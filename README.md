# Eluvio Hackathon Instructions

### Welcome!

Eluvio is thrilled to be part of this great Hackathon, and to work with all of you on great solutions to our API challenge.

The Eluvio Content Fabric is a work-in-progress, novel decentralized platform for managing, distributing, selling and enjoying digital content over the Internet. The platform combines together several new technologies we've built from ground: Fast, machine learning driven content routing and low-latency media streaming; Decentralized storage of media and metadata without duplication; Programmable, just-in time composition; Trustless content protection from creator to consumer; Blockchain-controlled content access; Smart contracts for multi-party transactions.
